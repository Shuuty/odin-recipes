        <li>150 g butter</li>
        <li>50g sugar</li>
        <li>50 g honey</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 orange</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>250 g of flour</li>
        <li>20 g of bitter cacao</li>
        <li>3 g baking soda</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 kg of pastry dulce de leche</li>
        <li>Rum or cognac</li>
        </ul>


        For the topping
        <ul>
        <li>240 g of sugar</li>
        <li>60 cc of water</li>
        <li>4 egg whites</li>
        <li>Juice of 1⁄2 squeezed lemon</li>
        <li>Extra powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the tapas, beat the soft butter with the sugar and honey until creamy. Perfume with the zest and essence. Add the egg, beating constantly. Sift the dry ingredients and add them to the batter until forming a dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Stretch the dough with a rolling pin and a little extra flour. Cut 5cm diameter discs and place them on a floured plate, spaced apart. With the oven preheated to 180°C, cook the tapas for 8 to 10 minutes, remove and let cool.</li>
            <li>For the topping, place the sugar and water in a deep pot until it reaches 118°C. You can use a kitchen thermometer or dip a teaspoon of the syrup in a glass of ice water: if it can be shaped into a ball, it is ready; If not, keep on the heat for a few more seconds. As soon as the syrup comes to a boil, begin to beat the egg whites. Once the syrup has reached its peak, pour it over the egg whites very slowly in the form of a thread while continuing to beat. Continue beating until the meringue is at room temperature. Add the lemon juice.</li>
            <li>To assemble, mix the dulce de leche with the cognac or rum. Fill the alfajores and cover them with a thin layer of meringue and immediately sprinkle them with powdered sugar and arrange them on a plate. Let them dry completely at room temperature in a dry place</li>
         </ol>
